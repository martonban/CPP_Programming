The compiler, archiver and linker are command line tool. You can give them different command and it will do it. The problem with this approche is very simple. Manageing big proojet with tis is imposible. You can miss files, give an incorrect or not detailed command enough etc. You can solve this issues with an IDE or a build system. 

IDEs is helping you to organize text files (.h, .c or .cpp files) into projects or it will help manage binaries. This softwares will give the user a GUI to make it more easier. For example Visual Studio, CLion or CodeBlocks

Build System on the other hand will help to magange the copiler. We create text files wich will gives rules for the build system to how compile. Like create an executable link this libray etc. This is called targets. There are a plenty build system you can use. For example GNU make, CMake (not exactly a build system) or Boost.Build.
