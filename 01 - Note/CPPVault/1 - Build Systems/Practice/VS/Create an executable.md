Building Systems/VS/Executable

## Description

This project is a really simple file writer console application. I am working my 3D rendering engine, and I will need a .csv file where I can store basic properties for the application and a separate .csv file where I can store the properties of a window.

This is a single file application. I used [this book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-cookbook/0596007612/) as a reference. (Chapter 4, 10)
